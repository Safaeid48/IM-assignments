Assignment 1

The graphs were plotted taking 7000 points in range(0 to 7) taking a step size of 0.001

From the above plot of the log,linear,square,cubic and polynomial functions we can see the growth rates of them from the range of 0 to 7 respectively. Polynimial function of power 4 grows really fast compared to the rest of the functions. The growth rates of the functions from the graph:

log(n) = n (roughly same) < n^2 < n^3 < n^4 where [0<=n<=7]

Within the range of roughly 2 we can see that all the functions grows at roughly the same rate. For values of n>2 the growth rates vary.
The function which grows at a slower rate is better as here these functions represent the time comlexity of an algorithm. Slower growth rate means that with more larger iterations it takes to run that algorithm with that time complexity. Looking at the growth rates we can tell which is the best function.
From the above graph we it is obvious that the log and linear function are the best as they have roughly the same growth rate in range of 0 to 7 iterations. further inspection is required to tell which one is better amongst these two functions more accurately.

From figure-1, 
it is clear that the linear function grows faster than the log function. Thus log function is the best function.

From the rest of the figures comparative growth of the functions are shown and the growth rate is confirmed to be of such:

log(n)<n<n^2<n^3<n^4 for [0<=n<=7]

Best function: log(n)
